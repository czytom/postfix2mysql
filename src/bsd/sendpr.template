Descrption:
New port:
        A hosting web GUI for admin and accounting
        apache/named/proftpd/qmail Domain Technologie Control
        (DTC) is a set of PHP scripts and a web interface that
        manage a MySQL database that handles all the host
        information. It generates backup scripts, statistic
        calculation scripts, and config files for bind, Apache,
        qmail, and proftpd, using a single system UID/GID. With
        DTC, you can delegate the task of creating subdomains,
        email, and FTP accounts to users for the domain names
        they own, and monitor bandwidth per user and service.
